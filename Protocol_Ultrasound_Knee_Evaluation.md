## 1. Synopsis

### 1.1 Study Rationale

Knee pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints encountered in clinical practice, affecting individuals across all age groups. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying pathology is crucial for appropriate treatment planning. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard for evaluating soft tissue structures of the knee, musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) has emerged as a valuable, cost-effective, and readily accessible alternative diagnostic modality.

### 1.2 Study Hypothesis

High-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound provides comparable diagnostic accuracy to MRI in the evaluation of common pathologies causing painful knee, including meniscal tears, ligamentous injuries, cartilage abnormalities, and synovial diseases.

### 1.3 Primary Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of musculoskeletal ultrasound compared to MRI in detecting structural abnormalities in patients presenting with painful knee.

### 1.4 Study Design Summary

This is a prospective, single-center, comparative diagnostic accuracy study. Patients presenting with painful knee will undergo both ultrasound and MRI examinations. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound will be compared against MRI as the reference standard.

### 1.5 Sample Size

A minimum of 100 patients will be enrolled based on sample size calculations for diagnostic accuracy studies.

### 1.6 Duration

The study duration is estimated to be 18 months (12 months for patient enrollment and 6 months for data analysis and reporting).

## 2. Introduction and Background

### 2.1 Knee Anatomy Overview

The knee joint is one of the largest and most complex joints in the human body. It consists of:

- **Bones**: Femur, tibia, patella, and fibula
- **Menisci**: Medial and lateral menisci serving as shock absorbers
- **Ligaments**: 
  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)
  - Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)
  - Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL)
  - Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL)
- **Tendons**: Quadriceps tendon, patellar tendon
- **Cartilage**: Articular cartilage covering bone surfaces
- **Synovium**: Synovial membrane lining the joint capsule
- **Bursae**: Suprapatellar, infrapatellar, prepatellar, and pes anserine bursae

### 2.2 Common Causes of Painful Knee

| Category | Pathologies |
|----------|-------------|
| **Traumatic** | Meniscal tears, ligament injuries (ACL/PCL/MCL/LCL), fractures, contusions |
| **Degenerative** | Osteoarthritis, meniscal degeneration, cartilage lesions |
| **Inflammatory** | Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudogout, synovitis |
| **Infectious** | Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis |
| **Tendon/Bursal** | Tendinopathy, bursitis, Baker's cyst |
| **Neoplastic** | Benign and malignant tumors |

### 2.3 Role of Imaging in Knee Evaluation

#### 2.3.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

MRI is considered the gold standard for evaluating knee pathology due to its:
- Excellent soft tissue contrast
- Multiplanar imaging capability
- Non-invasive nature without ionizing radiation
- High sensitivity and specificity for various knee pathologies

**Limitations:**
- High cost
- Limited availability
- Long examination time
- Contraindications (pacemakers, claustrophobia, metallic implants)
- Static imaging (no dynamic assessment)

#### 2.3.2 Musculoskeletal Ultrasound

Ultrasound has gained popularity as a diagnostic tool for knee evaluation due to:
- Real-time dynamic imaging
- Excellent accessibility and portability
- No ionizing radiation
- Lower cost compared to MRI
- Ability to perform image-guided interventions
- Comparison with contralateral side during examination

**Advantages over MRI:**
- Point-of-care availability
- Dynamic assessment (stress testing)
- Patient-friendly (no claustrophobia)
- Color Doppler for vascular assessment
- Ability to evaluate the knee in different positions

**Limitations:**
- Operator-dependent
- Limited assessment of deep structures (ACL, PCL)
- Difficulty in evaluating bone marrow
- Steep learning curve

### 2.4 Literature Review

Recent studies have demonstrated the emerging role of ultrasound in knee evaluation:

1. **Meniscal pathology**: Studies report sensitivity of 70-90% and specificity of 80-95% for meniscal tears
2. **Ligamentous injuries**: High accuracy for MCL/LCL injuries; limited for ACL/PCL
3. **Cartilage evaluation**: Emerging evidence for cartilage assessment using high-frequency probes
4. **Synovitis and effusion**: Excellent accuracy comparable to MRI
5. **Tendon and bursal pathology**: Comparable or superior to MRI

### 2.5 Rationale for the Study

Despite the growing evidence supporting ultrasound utility in knee evaluation, there remains a need for:
- Comprehensive comparison with MRI across all knee pathologies
- Standardized ultrasound examination protocols
- Evaluation of ultrasound's role in clinical decision-making
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
